# Solving Differential Equations in Classical Mechanics with Neural Networks

## Table of Contents
* **Notebook 1: Numerical Differential Equation Solvers**: Contains explanations of Euler's method, the Euler-Cromer method, and the Velocity-Verlet method.  Also includes a worked out example of these methods applied to solving for the position of an object in freefall with drag and a prompt for students to apply these methods to solve for the motion of a simple harmonic osciallator.  Filename: 01_differential_equations.ipynb
* **Notebook 2: Building a Neural Network from Scratch**: 
* **Notebook 3: Solving Differential Equations with Neural Networks**:
* **Notebook 4: Further Problems**: This contains a collection of further problems that cover both the conceptual topics and coding problems covered in the above three notebooks.  These could be used as quiz, exam, or homework questions as needed. Filename: 04_further_problems.ipynb
* **Notebook 5: Solutions**: This notebook contains solutions to all of the problems posed in Notebook 4, plus any questions posed in the first three notebooks of this module.  Will be removed in the final version of this module. Filename: 05_solutions.ipynb
