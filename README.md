Pre-requisites: this section should provide what prior knowledge has been assumed in this module. This should either be from the core prerequisites or other DSECOP modules. Any other concepts should be explained. A great way would be to create a 01_intro_to_xyz.ipynb notebook and offer the required introduction. Physical concepts should be brief as our focus is on the methodology while providing additional references can guide the student to learn the concept. Up to 60% of the module can be spent on the introduction if needed.
