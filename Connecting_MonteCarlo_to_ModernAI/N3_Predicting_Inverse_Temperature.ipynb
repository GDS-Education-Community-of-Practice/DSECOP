A better approach is to use our domain knowledge to pick a model that we know will be able to learn the $tanh(x)$ function directly and well.  Because $tanh(x)$ has two horizontal asymptotes and polynomial expressions do not, any polynomial-based model such as [SVR](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVR.html#sklearn.svm.SVR) is expected to behave poorly.

Instead, we will build one ourselves from scratch using *layers* and *activation functions*.  An example architecture is shown below ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network#/media/File:Typical_cnn.png)).\n",

        "#### Layers\n",
        "A *Covolutional Neural Network* is typically a mix of several different kinds of layers:\n",
        "- `convolutional layer`: This layer takes a matrix of data, then filters it to emphasize the most important information in the dataset.  The filters are learned and updated to be specific to the problem.  [See here for a good in-depth tutorial.](https://machinelearningmastery.com/convolutional-layers-for-deep-learning-neural-networks/)  You need the correct ratio of convolutional layers to the amount of data in your dataset.  Too few layers, and your model cannot learn all of the information it needs.  Too many layers, and your dataset may not have enough information for all of the layers to be helpful, leading to the untrained layers negatively affecting the trained layers.\n",
        "-  `pooling layer`: This layer reduces the size of the input matrix in order to emphasize big, important patterns in the input matrix.  *Max pooling* means that for an $n\\times n$ patch, only the maximum value of that patch is kept.  *Average pooling* means that the average value of the $n\\times n$ patch is kept. In both methods, small variations get filtered out.  For example, if the pooling layer has a stride of 2, the output of the layer will be 1/2 the size of the input to the layer.  No model information is stored in this layer, but you can \"lose\" too much information from previous layers if you aren't careful.  [See here for a good in-depth explanation.](https://machinelearningmastery.com/pooling-layers-for-convolutional-neural-networks/)\n",
        "-  `batch normalization`: This layer keeps all of the matrix values centered around zero.  If the distribution of the values shifts too far from zero, it can take a longer time for the model to learn the distribution.  [See here for a good in-depth explanation.](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/batch-normalization-cnn)\n",
        "-  `flatten`: This is a layer that reshapes the matrix of data into a vector.  No model information is stored in this layer.\n",
        "-  `dense`: These are exactly the same layers used in the FC-DNN example above; the difference is that they are no longer fully connected.  For regression and classification tasks, a model is expected to return a number or set of numbers (vector), not a matrix.  This layer learns the best vector to represent the input created by layers earlier in the network.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many types of layers available, and each has its own nuances.  [See here for a complete list of layers available in the Keras Python package.](https://keras.io/api/layers/)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Activation Functions\n",
        "After choosing the layers, the next thing to understand is the `activation` function for each layer.  [See here for a good overview of the different activation functions.](https://towardsdatascience.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-activation-functions-in-deep-learning-models-84ba9f82c253)  Two different activation functions are selected for the model below: `relu` and `sigmoid`.  The reasons for choosing these two functions are discussed in the [Model Intuition section at the end of this notebook](#model_intuition).\n",

        "## Intuition for the CNN Model\n",
        "\n",
        "The CNN model provided has the following sequence:\n",
        "\n",
        ">0. **Input**: accepts an input matrix of size [$\\sqrt{N}+2$, $\\sqrt{N}+2$, $1$] because this is the size we defined for our Ising lattices.  There is a $1$ in the size definition because even though the lattice is not 3D, the python function still requires a defined value along the third dimension.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, the lattice size is $122 \\times 122 \\times 1$.\n",
        "\n",
        ">1. **Conv2D**: first pass at learning the spatial relationships and values of the lattice\n",
        ">2. **Conv2D**: second pass at learning the spatial relationships and values of the lattice\n",
        "\n",
        "We want the model to have a good opportunity to figure out the most important details about the data before we reduce the lattice size.  If the data is very noisy, or has a lot of very small domains that distinguish it from lattices at similar temperatures, the model should have information at this scale.  A `kernel_size=(3,3)` argument means that a matrix of size $3 \\times 3$ is convolved across the matrix.  Depending the size of the magnetic domains, a $3 \\times 3$ kernel size may learn relevant information, or the model may benefit from a larger kernel of $5 \\times 5$. Larger than $5 \\times 5$ is typically not used (even for very large matrices), and $4 \\times 4$ is not used because it is even.\n",
        "\n",
        "Like the *nearest-neighbor* calculation in the previous notebook, which required the lattice to have some padding or skip calculating values for the atoms on the edges of the lattice, the convolution operation requires special handling at the edges.  The `padding=\"same\"` argument puts zeros around the edges to keep the matrix size constant; otherwise it decreases by 2 along each dimension every time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the `Conv2D` layer does not output a single lattice: it outputs `filters=32`  *feature maps* of the input lattice, where each feature map is a version of the input that emphasizes different information.  For example, one filter might emphasize only edges of domains in the input lattice, another filter might emphasize only the smallest domains, and yet another might emphasize only the largest domains.\n",
        "\n",
        ">3. **MaxPool2D**: Reduces the lattice size by 2 in each dimension, so we can expect the output to be [$0.5(\\sqrt{N}+2)$, $0.5(\\sqrt{N}+2)$, 1).\n",
        "\n",
        "As the data moves deeper into the network, it is condensed.  (This layer can be thought of in terms of the [Renormalization Group flow](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9110872) of the lattice.)  Since only one-fourth of the of the lattice remains, and the initial size was $120 \\times 120$ before padding, the lattice is now $60 \\times 60$.  Larger domains have shrunk, and smaller domains have disappeared or become specks.  However, because of the number of `filters` in the `Conv2D` layers is still large, we can think of this layer as sorting lattice patterns into different parts of a large $M \\times M \\times P$ *feature vector*.\n",
        "\n",
        ">4. **Conv2D**: Now the network is learning \"medium\" sized patterns, and the number of feature maps created has increased to $filters=64$.\n",
        ">5. **MaxPool2D**: Reduces the lattice again, so that it is now one-sixteenth of its original size.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, the lattice size is $30 \\times 30$.  Another convolutional layer is added to the model to learn smaller patterns, followed by a `BatchNormalization()` layer.\n",
        "\n",
        ">6. **Conv2D**: Same parameters as Layer #4, only now learning even more finely grained features.\n",
        ">7. **BatchNormalization**: This centers the data around zero and gives a maximum value of 1.\n",
        ">8. **Flatten**: Reshapes all of the matrices values into one long vector\n",
        "\n",
        "The `BatchNormalization()` layer is important, because up until this point, the matrix values passed by the `relu` activation function have been allowed to spread between $[0, \\infty]$.  We need the value returned for the inverse temperature $\\beta$ to be $\\beta \\in [0, 1]$, and the normalization makes sure the values are centered around zero with a standard deviation of 1 before the data moves into the fully connected layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, since the `dense` layers require a vector input, the output matrices of the convolutional layers is reshaped by the `flatten` layer.\n",
        "\n",
        ">9. **Dense**: This layer takes all of the values created at this point and combines them into $64$ numbers.  A `sigmoid` activation function is used to keep the values between [0, 1].\n",
        "\n",
        "Moving directly from the full set of matrix values to a single number requires the model to condense all of the information very quickly, without much opportunity to shift the data distribution correctly.  Adding Layer 9 before the final output helps correct for this.\n",
        "\n",
        ">10. **Dense**: This layer returns a single number, the predicted value for $\\beta$.\n",
