    "### Training Considerations\n",
    "#### Architecture\n",
    "The architecture and associated hyperparameters have significant impact on the performance of the PINN. The learning model architecture can be customized depending on the nature of the domain. For example, CNNs, RNNs and GNNs can be used for spatial, temporal and interacting problems respectively. For the one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator workflow, we use a FCN with 7 layers of 10 neurons each. \n",
    "The choice of activation functions is constrained by the fact that they have to be $ (n+1) $-differentiable for $ n $-order PDEs. For the one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator problem we use $ \\tanh $ activation functions because they are 3-differentiable.\n",
    "Optimizer selection is important for convergence of the learner and to avoid solutions at local minima. It has been shown that a combination of Adam at early training and L-BFGS . We use the Adam optimizer only given the relatively simple nature of this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collocation Points\n",
    "The accuracy of the NN increases with increase in density of collocation points. However, the computational resources required also increases exponentially with the increase in density of points. This can lead to training bottlenecks, especially for high dimensional systems. A trade-off has to be made between the desired accuracy and number of collocation points because training the NN on a large number of points may lead to overfitting and adversely affect generalisability. The distribution of points can also be customised according to the problem domain. Density could be increased around areas of sharp discontinuities to capture more information about the domain. For the one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator, we use 1000 points per unit length of the domain interior with random sampling.\n",
