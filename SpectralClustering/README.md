## Summary

This module can be used as a supplementary material for a classical mechanics course. The first part of the module consists of an introduction to coupled oscillating system and a simple simulation of the oscillating particles. The second part of the module leads the student to observe the structure of the differential equation and generalize the method to clustering algorithm. The last part of the module helps the student to use the newly developed algorithm to do clustering on an example dataset. 

## Description

Clustering algorithm is an important unsupervised learning technique in data science . A good clustering method could help data scientists to find  important features and boost existing models.  This module leads the student to observe a natrual clustering algorithm from a real physics problem. By studying with this module, student could also visualize coupled spring system which will help them to understand coupled ordinary differential equations. 

The prerequiste of the module is classical mechanics, solving ordinary differential equation and linear algebra.
