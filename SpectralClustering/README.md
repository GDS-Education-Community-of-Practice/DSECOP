DSECOP

## Summary

This module introduces a commonly used unsupervised learning method in data science, the spectral clustering. The method can be derived from a physical view. Thus, this module can be used as a supplementary material for an undergraduate classical mechanics course. The first part of the module consists of an introduction to coupled oscillating system and a simple simulation of the oscillating particles. The second part of the module leads the student to observe the structure of the differential equation and generalize the method to a spectral embedding to put similar data closer to each other. The parts 3 and 4 introduces K-means and how the clustering algorithm should be integrated with the spectral embedding to produce spectral clustering algorithm. The last part introduces the standard package that implements the method. 

## Description

Clustering algorithm is an important unsupervised learning technique in data science . A good clustering method could help data scientists to find  important features and boost existing models.  This module leads the student to observe a natrual clustering algorithm from a real physics problem. By studying with this module, student could also visualize coupled spring system which will help them to understand coupled ordinary differential equations. 

The module does not require experience with python or coding. However, understanding of eigen space, basic linear algebra, classical mechanics and coupled ordinary differential equations should be required. Thus, this module can serve as a good supplemental material for undergraduate classical mechanics course to students who already mastered the skill in coupled oscillating systems.   

## Materials

1. The course can be divided into 5 parts and each parts should take at most 20 mins to cover.
2. In each part, there are a couple of homework problems and maybe a quiz following the course material.
3. The suggested pace would be to cover the first two parts in a 50 mins course and the last three parts in another 50 mins course.
4. The module can also serve as a self-study material for course final projects.
5. People who use this module are welcome to provide suggestions and add materials.
