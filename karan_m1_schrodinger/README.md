# Module 1: Schrödinger Equation

This module can be used can be used for a Quantum Mechanics course. The module will begin with introduction to the Schrödinger Equation including a tutorial on analytical 
solutions for different toy systems such as Particle-In-A-Box, Quantum Harmonic Oscillator etc. The second portion of this module will consist of a brief primer on numerical 
techniques for solving differential equations. Finally, deep learning will be introduced with code examples and students would be expected to compare the numerical and deep 
learning methods with the analytical solution for a system of their choice.
