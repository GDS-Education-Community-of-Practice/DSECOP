        "## Introduction to Data Science Libraries\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook will introduce you to three libraries commonly used in data science and help analyze physics data. Pandas provide ways to easily import data from a file and save it in something called a Pandas Dataframe, which allows us to easily display the data as a table, access the different columns of data, and begin formatting the data for later analysis. The other two libraries introduced in this notebook, Seaborn and Matplotlib, are used to create graphs from the data set. Each graphing library has its strengths and reasons to use, which will be discussed later in the notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "It maybe easier to think about these libraries by thinking about their relationships to each other.  NumPy, one of the standard Python libraries, provides an implementation of a data structure called arrays, which allows us to easily manipulate one and two dimensional data sets.  However, it can be hard to display a matrix of data and extract different column, especially since NumPy does not provide headers for its columns.  Pandas is simply a wrapper for NumPy arrays which provides an easy way to display, access, and manipulate two dimensional data sets. However, underneath the hood it is simply using NumPy arrays.\n",
        "\n",
        "Likewise, Matplotlib is the simplest graphing library avaliable in Python and its default graphs are quite plain.  Seaborn is a wrapper of the Matplotlib class which adds more formatting to the default graphs and also provides the creation of some compound graphs, such as `pairplot` that we will look at below."

        "## Introduction to the Data Set\n",
        "\n",
        "The data set we will investigate in this notebook contains the following data for every measurable isotope: number of neutrons, number of protons, number of nucleons, binding energy, the uncertainty of binding energy measurement, atomic mass, and uncertainty on mass measurement. This notebook section will help you better understand this data set and why nuclear scientists may want to study it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Isotopes and Nucleons\n",
        "\n",
        "The nucleus of an atom contains two types of particles: positively charged particles called **protons** and neutral particles called **neutrons**. The total number of protons in the nucleus is Z, and the total number of neutrons is N. Protons and neutrons are both types of **nucleons**, so the total number of nucleons in the nucleus is A = Z + N.\n",
        "\n",
        "The number of protons in the nucleus determines what **element** it is. For example, all nuclei with 12 protons are carbon nuclei, all nuclei with 1 proton are hydrogen, and all nuclei with 20 protons are calcium. However, the number of neutrons in a nucleus does not define an element. So there are carbon atoms with 11 neutrons, 12 neutrons, 13 neutrons, and so on. Nuclei that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are referred to as **isotopes** of each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Atomic Mass\n",
        "\n",
        "An atom's **atomic mass** is the atom's total mass (i.e., the nucleus and the protons). Note that it is not the same as the sum of the masses of the particles that make up the atom. This will be explored in the next section.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Binding Energy\n",
        "\n",
        "The mass of an atomic nucleus will be less than the total mass of its constituent particles. This difference in mass is called the binding energy, as it is the energy required to hold the atom together. Remember that mass and energy are related by the famous equation from Einstein: $E = mc^2$.\n",
        "\n",
        "To calculate the theoretical binding energies using Einstein's equation, we can define the binding energy as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$BE = Mc^2 - mc^2,$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where M is the total mass of all of the particles in the atom, m is the actual atomic mass of the atom, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum. We can define M as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$M = Z(m_p + m_e) + Nm_n,$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where m$_p$ is the mass of a proton, m$_e$ is the mass of an electron, and m$_n$ is the mass of a neutron. So, we can rewrite the binding energy as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$BE = ((m_p + m_e)Z + m_nN - m)c^2.$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we can define the atomic mass of hydrogen as one proton plus one electron:\n",
        "$$m_h = m_p + m_e,$$\n",
        "\n",
        "which means we can rewrite the binding energy as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$BE = (m_hZ + m_nN - m)c^2,$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $m_h$ = 1.007 MeV, $m_n$ = 1.008 MeV and $c^2$ = 931.49 MeV/u.\n",
        "\n",
        "The binding energies in the data set are experimental binding energies. Later in this notebook, we will determine how well the experimental binding energies correspond to the theoretical ones we defined in this section.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Uncertainties\n",
        "\n",
        "The atomic masses and binding energies in this data set were collected through experiments. Any data collected through experimentation has uncertainty in it. Though these are usually relatively small, they are also presented in this data set."

Most of the time, this will include ensuring the data is the correct type (i.e., numeric or words) and that every entry in the Dataframe is filled out. Every column of the Dataframe should be numeric except for the element symbol. However, when `nuclear_data` is printed, some of the rows contain \"#\"s next to the number. This indicates that the value results from an extrapolation instead of an experimental result, but adding the \"#\" does mean that that entry is no longer a number. We need the expected numeric data for later analysis, so the following code cell will force the last four columns to be numeric. This will convert the entries with \"#\" to \"NaN,\" which stands for \"not a number.\" This makes these entries easier to remove.\n",

Plotting N as a function of Z gives us an interesting graph showing how many isotopes occur for each element. Likewise, plotting binding energy as a function of either N, Z, or A shows us the binding energy sharply increases initially but then curves and starts to decrease. The shape of this graph is important in nuclear physics because it helps explain why some nuclei undergo fission as a decay process while others undergo fusion. Note that you may see this graph presented upside down. Plotting mass as a function of N, Z, or A does not give us anything unexpected since we would expect the mass to increase as the number of particles grows. Finally, plotting the uncertainties as a function of anything does not make sense since they only depend on the measurement they were made with.\n",
