# Introduction to Random Forest

This module contains data science educational materials for an introduction to the random forest method and its applications in Exoplanet Science.

## Summary

Random forest is a machine learning algorithm trademarked by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler. This method can be used for both classification and regression problems. This module aims to introduce the fundamental concepts of Random Forest algorithm and their applications in Exoplanet Science from a pragmatic educational perspective.

## Module Contents

The contents of this module are: 

* **Notebook 1: An Introduction to the Random Forest Method** , in which we explain the basic concepts and ideas behind this algorithm,
* **Notebook 2: Using Random Forest for Classifying Exoplanets**, in which we use a random forest algorithm to solve an exoplanetary problem.


## Suggested Course to Plug Into

The contents of this module are relevant and can be integrated with any Physics course that is data/compute-intensive. These include

* Astronomical courses
* Scientific Computing courses
* Biomedical and Biophysics courses
* Particle Physics and Statistical Physics courses



## Time Needed to Complete the Module

Expected time investments would be 2-3 hours in class/lab. Both Notebooks could be compeleted in the class. Completing Notebook 2's optional homework and project should take at most 1 hour.
 


## Prerequisites

Readers and practitioners are expected to be familiar with Calculus.
These are in addition to the core prerequisites of DSECOP modules:

Base python - variables/functions/loops/data structures

Core functionalities of Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib

Knowledge of using Google Colab: for a beginner's guide, check out Colab's guide as well as this notebook

Basics of working with git and GitHub

Elementary statistics knowledge.
