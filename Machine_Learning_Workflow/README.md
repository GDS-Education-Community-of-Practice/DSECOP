## Learning Goals

### Physics Learning Goals
* Notebook 1: No physics learning goals
* Notebook 2:
    * Reinforce previous lessons on Newtonian Gravitation and Newton's second law
    * Understand net force equations and how they related to Newton's second law

### Data Science Learning Goals
* Understand the steps of the machine learning workflow and how to apply them to different data sets
* Understand how linear regression works and how to implement it using the Scikit-Learn library
* Be able to frame a set of equations as a linear regression problem with a design matrix and appply physical meaning to the linear regression weights

## Suggested Course to Plug Into
As a note, all of these notebooks can be plugged into a computational physics course.
* Notebook 2: Introductory Mechanics or Classical Mechanics
