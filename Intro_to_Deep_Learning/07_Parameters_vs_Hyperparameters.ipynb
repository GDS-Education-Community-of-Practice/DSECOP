    "The logistic regression model's output and input are related by the two parameter sets $\\omega$ and $b$. These are called **model parameters**. But we also use an activation function such as sigmoid function $\\sigma(z)$. Do we call it another parameter of the model? The answer is no. We define it manually, and it does not change **within** the *learning process*. Therefore, an activation function is a **Hyperparameter** in the neural network. In general, *Hyperparameters* are those parameters explicitly defined by the user to control the learning process, whereas *Model parameters* are configuration variables internal to the model, and the model has to **learn them**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of hyperparameters is the learning rate in the gradient descent model. How do we choose it? Should it be $0.01$ or $0.05$, for example? We do not know! The hyperparameter is defined based on prior knowledge of the problem or by try and error!"
