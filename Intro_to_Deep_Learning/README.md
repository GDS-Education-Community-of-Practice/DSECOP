# Introduction to Deep Learning
This module contains contains data science educational materials for an introduction to Deep Learning and its applications in Physics.

# Summary

Deep Learning is playing an increasingly major role in Physical Sciences, in particular, in topics that have
been traditionally computationally intensive, such as Molecular Dynamics, Cosmological N-body
simulations, computational Biophysics (e.g., proteomics), Biomedicine, and Astronomy. 
The purpose of this module is to introduce the fundamental concepts of Deep Learning ad their applications in Physics from a pragmatic educational perspective.

# Module Contents

The contents of this module are broadly classified into three separate categories:

+   Lectures and tutorials
+   Labs and Homework
+   Quizzes

# Related Physics Courses

The contents of this module are relevant to and can be integrated with any Physics course that is data/compute-intensive. These include

+   Astronomical courses
+   Scientific Computing courses
+   Biomedical and Biophysics courses
+   Particle Physics and Statistical Physics courses

# Learning Objectives

The goal of this module is to introduce the fundamental concepts of Deep Learning, specifically Neural Networks to Physics students.  
A broad overview of the topics considered in this module is given in [this README.md file](./lectures/README.md).

# Expected time investments

The contents of this module are equivalent to 1-credit course, or 1-1.5 months of student/professor time in a classroom setting.

# Prerequisites

Readers and practitioners are expected to be familiar with Calculus, Differentiation and differential equations, and Matrix Algebra.  
These are in addition to the [core prerequisites]() of DSECOP modules:

+ Base python - variables/functions/loops/data structures
+ Core functionalities of `Numpy`, `Pandas`, and `Matplotlib`
+ Knowledge of using Google Colab: for a beginner's guide check out Colab's guide as well as this notebook.
+ Basics of working with git and Github
+ Elementary statistics knowledge
