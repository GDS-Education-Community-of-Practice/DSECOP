# Electromagnestim_Supplementary_Exercises

## Module Summary
During the DSECOP conference in summer of 2023 it became that there was a large demand from instructors for material that can be covered in standard electromagnetism courses. This module is made to be incorporated into such a course. It has 3 parts of increasing difficulty: 1. Visualizing field lines for charge configurations 2. Using coulomb's law and a linear regression to find the charge of an atom 3. Solving the wave equation using neural networks.
It ties in to two other DSECOP modules: ["Machine Learning Workflow" by Julie Butler](https://github.com/GDS-Education-Community-of-Practice/DSECOP/tree/main/Machine_Learning_Workflow), and ["Solving Differential Equations with NNs" by Radha Mastandrea](https://github.com/GDS-Education-Community-of-Practice/DSECOP/tree/main/Solving_Differential_Equations_with_NNs). The material in these notebooks is pedagogically walked through in those modules.

## Module Summary (Shortened)
This module aims to introduce electromagnetism students to visualization, linear regression, and neural networks.

## Keywords
Electromagnetism, Visualization, Linear Regression, Neural Networks, Wave Equation


## Table of Contents

**01_Visualization.ipynb**: Students work through a Griffith's problem and visualize the electromagnetic field lines in 3D space.

**02_Linear_Regressions.ipynb** Students use a linear regression to determine the proton content of a nucleus based on data of its orbiting electron (a toy problem with no quantum mechanics).

**03_Learning_DiffEqs.ipynb** Students use a simple Neural Network to find standing wave solutions to the wave equation.

**electron_data.csv**: The data set needed for Notebook 2.

## Pre-requisities

Different notebooks require different level of background. The first requires basic python knowledge, the second requires knowing linear regressions (which can be learned with the Machine Learning Workflow notebook), the third requires neural networks (which can be learned with the Solving Differential Equations notebook).


## Learning Goals

### Physics

This notebook supplements a standard Griffith's E&M course. Students should leave with a more intimate understanding of electromagnetic fields and waves.


### Data Science

The data science objectives from this module are as follows:
* Be able to visualize equations in 3D space
* Be able to load data from a .csv
* Be able to perform a linear regression
* Be able to use a simple neural network
* Be able to tweak hyperparameters (optional)

## Suggested Course to Plug Into

Electromagnetism.

## Time Needed for Students to Complete the Assignments: 5 hours

The first notebook should take 1 hour, 2 hours for the second, and 2 hours for the 3rd.
