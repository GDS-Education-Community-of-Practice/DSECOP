# Exploratory Data Analysis

TODO

## Learning goals

After completing this module, students should feel comfortable:

(Physics Goals)
- performing short, spontaneous analyses to familiarize themselves with a new dataset

(Data Science Goals)
- using built-in functions from ```numpy``` and ```scipy``` to preprocess data before running more intensive machine learning analyses on it

## Prerequisites

Students are expected to be familiar with ```python```, ```numpy```, and  ```matplotlib```. 

## What's included in this module?

### In-class notebooks

Two in-class notebooks WILL guide students through various preliminary topics in data analysis. The notebooks will cover:
- Exploratory data analysis (```01_dataset_cleaning.ipynb```)
- Preprocessing techniques for neural networks (```02_preprocessing_techniques.ipynb```)


Estimated time to complete: 30-45 minutes per notebook 

### Conceptual Quiz Questions
N/A

### Homework Assignment
