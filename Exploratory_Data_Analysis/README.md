# Exploratory Data Analysis

The module can be seen as a collection of standalone notebooks, each one covering a more niche topic in data science. The notebooks provide in-depth explorations of specific analysis topics that students are generally expected to "know beforehand" or pick up on the fly. 

The first notebook covers *Exploratory Data Analysis*,  a technique used to quickly gain a broad understanding of a (typically unfamiliar) dataset as a means to inform and guide future analyses.

The second notebook explains and investigates four common *preprocessing techniques* used in machine learning (Minmax, Standard, Robust, and Quantile scaling).  

## Learning goals

After completing this module, students should feel comfortable:

- performing short, spontaneous analyses to familiarize themselves with a new dataset
- choosing a preprocessing technique for a given dataset before running a more intensive machine learning analysis on it
- using built-in functions from ```numpy``` and ```scipy``` to preprocess data before running a more intensive machine learning analysis on it

## Prerequisites

Students are expected to be familiar with ```python```, ```numpy```, and  ```matplotlib```. 

## What's included in this module?

### In-class notebooks

Two in-class notebooks WILL guide students through various preliminary topics in data analysis. The notebooks will cover:
- Exploratory data analysis (```01_dataset_cleaning.ipynb```)
- Preprocessing techniques for neural networks (```02_preprocessing_techniques.ipynb```)


Estimated time to complete: 30-45 minutes per notebook 

### Conceptual Quiz Questions
N/A

### Homework Assignment
N/A

### Datasets

Two datasets are provided to accompany the notebook ```01_dataset_cleaning.ipynb```. 


## What courses might this module accompany?
This module would be well-suited to accompany a general course in data science techniques for the physical sciences (or a specific subfield of a physical science). The first notebook in particular would be very apropriate as a first homework assignment for any laboratory course.

### TODO
- [ ] Possibly adding in a quiz module
- [ ] Possibly adding in a HW module
- [ ] Remove some of the code to students have something to do
