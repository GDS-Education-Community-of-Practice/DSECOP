It states that a neural network with one hidden layer and a finite number of neurons can approximate any function to any given accuracy.  Of course in practice it may be hard to train a neural network to an accuracy wanted, but we can generally get the accuracy relatively high.  \n","\n","The Universal Approximation Theorem is important for this module because we will be using it to validate the use of neural networks to model the position of an object.  We will do this given only the acceleration of the object and will work up to creating a neural network that models the position.  In doing so, we will be creating a neural network that solves the following differential equation:\n","\n","$$\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = a(t,v,y,\\vec{c}),$$\n","\n","where the acceleration of the object, a, may be a function of time, velocity, position, and/or any constants $\\vec{c}$.\n","\n","The below code cells walk you through the process of setting up a neural network that will solve a second order differential equation (in this case using acceleration to find position).  We will compare the results from the neural network to both the exact solution and the results from numerically solving the differential equation using the Velocity-Verlet method (the most accurate of the numerical differential equation solvers investigated)."],"metadata":{"id":"-ctuRPTG8k9M"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Overview of Solving Differential Equations with Neural Networks\n","\n","When solving differential equations with neural networks, we assume that the neural network will approximate the function that we are trying to solve and we train the neural network so that its n-th derivative matches the nth-order differential equation we are trying to solve.  For example, when solving for position given acceleration, we can formalate this as a second order differential equation.  Therefore, when we are approximating the position on an object with a neural network, we want to train the network such that its second derivative is as close to the known acceleration as possible.\n","\n","Deriving a neural network may seem like an abstract concept, but the same automatic differentiation library we used in Notebook 2 (JAX) can be used to derive a neural network."],"metadata":{"id":"xo0TGzeR_AsL"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"oNVpdxqzJnn5"},"outputs":[],"source":["# IMPORTS\n","# Math for the ceiling function\n","from math import ceil\n","# Matplotlib for graphing capabilities\n","from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n","import numpy as np\n","# Modules from the JAX library for creating neural networks\n","import jax.numpy as jnp\n","from jax import grad\n","from jax import random as npr"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"R3WZG7PocnKH"},"source":["## Support Function\n","\n","The below two code cells define a function that calcualtes the root mean-squared error between two NumPy arrays (for error analysis) and the a common activation function for neural networks (the sigmoid function)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"mWEp7FJeXNa0"},"outputs":[],"source":["def rmse(A,B):\n","    \"\"\"\n","        Inputs:\n","            A,B (NumPy arrays)\n","        Returns:\n","            Unnamed (a float): the RMSE error between A and B\n","        Calculates the RMSE error between A and B.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    assert len(A)==len(B),\"The data sets must be the same length to calcualte\\\n","        the RMSE.\"\n","    return np.sqrt(np.average((A-B)**2)) "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"NDrQsV8Vcnzj"},"outputs":[],"source":["def sigmoid(x):\n","    \"\"\"\n","        Calculates the value of the sigmoid function for \n","        a given input of x\n","    \"\"\"\n","    return 1. / (1. + jnp.exp(-x))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_xJT2d_ykwLM"},"source":["## Defining the Model\n","\n","Now let's define the analytic solution for our position as well as the Velocity-Verlet solution.

The output of a neural network depends on many factors, three of which being the learning rate, the number of training iterations, and the number of neurons in each hidden layer.  Hyperparameter tuning is a process through which we train the network using various combinations of values for these parameters to see which combination gives us the best results.\n","\n","The below code cell runs a small hyperparameter tuning process on our neural network.  Note that even though only three options are used for the learning rate, the number of training iterations, and the number of neurons in the hidden layer we will be training and analyzing 27 different neural networks, so this is a time consuming process even with a small number of options.\n","\n","**WARNING**: The below cell will take a long time to run!"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"RbjuAfgHi4S5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1655158074435,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":1258783,"user":{"displayName":"Julie Butler Hartley","userId":"16397466870240358107"}},"outputId":"a1a7c2b2-8dd0-4157-c79d-901c1595ef54"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.0001 25 2 ) 6.825785639881246\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.0001 25 5 ) 4.634791661544085\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.0001 25 10 ) 2.609767987482142\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.0001 50 2 ) 3.300284543361196\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.0001 50 5 ) 1.0619449696315955\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.0001 50 10 ) 0.5578047367414414\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.0001 100 2 ) 0.4883778096095776\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.0001 100 5 ) 0.5416812386045258\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.0001 100 10 ) 0.08299809479157315\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.001 25 2 ) 1.2486916624075954\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.001 25 5 ) 0.39695221178248846\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.001 25 10 ) 0.09494330770895291\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.001 50 2 ) 0.7942214993333072\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.001 50 5 ) 0.1955415092141123\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.001 50 10 ) 0.04840992014028787\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.001 100 2 ) 0.16108626524869032\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.001 100 5 ) 0.03549627366372666\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.001 100 10 ) 0.02141359789627577\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.01 25 2 ) 0.2982068065535346\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.01 25 5 ) 9.040424014569785\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.01 25 10 ) nan\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.01 50 2 ) 0.1645828002303167\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.01 50 5 ) 9.040399242006798\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.01 50 10 ) nan\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.01 100 2 ) 0.07011052816014987\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.01 100 5 ) 9.040264569646913\n","Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.01 100 10 ) nan\n","Best Hyperparameter Combination and Error: ( 0.001 100 10 ) 0.02141359789627577\n"]}],"source":["best_err = 100\n","best_lr = None\n","best_num = None\n","best_neurons = None\n","for lr in [0.0001, 0.001, 0.01]:\n","    for num in [25, 50, 100]:\n","        for neurons in [2, 5, 10]:\n","            W = [npr.normal(key,(1, neurons)), npr.normal(key,(neurons, 1))]\n","            for i in range(num):\n","                loss_grad =  grad(loss_function)(W, t)\n","\n","                W[0] = W[0] - lr * loss_grad[0]\n","                W[1] = W[1] - lr * loss_grad[1]\n","            res = [y_trial(ti, neural_network(W, ti)[0][0]) for ti in t] \n","            err = rmse(y_exact,res)\n","            print(\"Hyperparameter Combination and Error: (\",lr, num,neurons,\")\",err)\n","            if err < best_err:\n","                best_err = err\n","                best_lr = lr\n","                best_num = num\n","                best_neurons = neurons\n","print(\"Best Hyperparameter Combination and Error: (\",best_lr, best_num, best_neurons,\")\",best_err)          "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**EXERCISE 2:** What was the optimal set of parameters and what was the associated RMSE error?

Consider a box sliding across a rough surface.  The box is given a push such that its initial velocity is 10m/s and the coefficient of static friction between the box and the surface is 0.01.  What is the analytical expression for the motion of the box?  How long does it take until the box will stop moving (this will be our tfinal)?\n","2. Create a function that will produce the analytical position of the box at a given time.  Consider what other parameters may need to be arguments of this function as well (mass of box, kinetic coefficient of friction, etc.).\n","3. Create a function that numerically solves for the position of the box using the Velocity-Verlet method.  What should be the arguments to this function?\n","4. Considering the intial conditions of the box (y$_0$ = 0m and v$_0$ = 10m/s), what should the trial solution for the neural network solution be?  Create a function called y_trial with your answer (use the above y_trial function as a guide).  \n","5. Using the loss function and neural network training code above (just copy and paste it below), train a neural network for your new system.  How do the results of your neural network compare to the exact solution and to the Velocity-Verlet solution?\n","6. Are you happy with the results from your neural network?  If not, try to use a combination of hyperparameter tuning and reducing the step size to improve your results.\n","7. As the coefficient of kinetic friction is increase, the position of the box as a function of time should become less linear and more quadratic.  Rerun your code with a kinetic coefficient of friction of 0.1 and then 1.0.  How does increasing this coefficient change the accuracy of the Velocity-Verlet and neural network results?\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"pTDFZSXzuJ_S"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"collapsed_sections":[],"name":"03_solving_differential_equations_neural_networks.ipynb","provenance":[],"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyP0p6mHRPowXI2W3dCmBm4m"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
