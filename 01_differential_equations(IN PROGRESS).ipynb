A differential equation is said to be of the n-th order if the highest order derivative in the differential equation is to the n-th order.  For example $y''+y' = 2y$ is a second order differential equation, $\\frac{dy}{dx} = y$ is a first order differential equation, and $y^{(3)} + y^{(5)} = 2y$ is a 5th order differential equation.\n","\n","Differential equations of many orders are important in physics, but this module will focus only on second order differential equations (meaning the highest order derivative will be to the second order).  These second order differential equations are found in equations for acceleration ($a(t) = \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}$) in classical mechanics and in Schrodinger's equation in quantum mechanics, for example."],"metadata":{"id":"sxzeV7zwQmrY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Numerical Methods for Solving Differential Equations\n","\n","Numerical methods are algorithms which allow mathematical propblems to be solved approximately, but in a method that can be easily programmed. Numerically solving differential equations can be a bit tricky because the solution to a differential equation sould be a continous function, but computers can only solve problems in a discretized manner.  Therefore, we have to employ numerical methods which can solve these equations in a discretized manner.  Note that this means that we will get the solution of our differential equation only at certain points, instead of a continous solution as you would get from solving analytically, but numerical solvers can easily handle equations that would be difficult or impossible to solve analytically.\n","\n","This section of the notebook will discuss four numerical methods for solving second order differential equations.  They are aranged below in order of increasing accuracy.  Each of the below methods will assume that the equation for the second order differential equation is known, and they will solving for the first order derivative as well as the original equation."],"metadata":{"id":"j6gMf9OHVaEQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### An Introduction to Discretization for Numerical Methods\n","\n","Let's assume that we know the equation for the velocity of an object as a function of time, v(t), and we want to find the position of that object with respect to time.  Analytically, we know that the velocity of an object is just the derivative of the position with respect to time:\n","$$v(t) = \\frac{dy(t)}{dt},$$ which means that we can find the position function analytically by simply integrating the velocity equation: $$y(t) = \\int_{t_{initial}}^{t_{final}} v(t)dt.$$\n","\n","However, when solving for the position function analytically, we have to take a different approach to discretize all of the variables.  Assuming we are only taking a very small time step, we can rewrite the derivative for velocity in an approximate form: $$v(t) = \\frac{dy(t)}{dt} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta t}.$$\n","\n","Here we have used the variable $\\Delta t$, which is known as the time step.  We can define the time step as: $$\\Delta t = \\frac{t_{final}-t_{initial}}{n},$$ where n is the number of points we wish to solve for position at.\n","\n","We can expand our approximate equation for velocity as: $$v(t) \\approx \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{y(t+\\Delta t) - y(t)}{\\Delta t}.$$\n","\n","Now we can solve the above equation to get an equation for the position (removing the approximation, especially for $\\Delta t$ $\\approx$ 0): $$y(t+\\Delta t) = y(t) + v(t)\\Delta t.$$\n","\n","From here we need to introduce a notation for discritized variables.  First for time.  We can say that the time at the ith point we are performing the calculation at can be written as: $$t \\longrightarrow t_i = t_{initial} + i\\Delta t,$$ for i = 0, 1, ..., n.  From  here we can also define discretized forms of our position and velocity equations using the same notation: $$y(t) \\longrightarrow y(t_i) = y_i$$ $$v(t) \\longrightarrow v(t_i) = v_i$$\n","\n","We also need to introduce the following notation for a position or velocity that is one time step ahead of or behind the ith point:\n","$$y_{i\\pm1} = y(t_i \\pm \\Delta t)$$ $$v_{i\\pm1} = v(t_i \\pm \\Delta t)$$\n","\n","Now, combining all of this together, we can write an equation for the position of the object in discretized form: $$y_{i+1} = y_i + v_i\\Delta t.$$. So, given an equation for the velocity of a system, the time step, and the initial conditions (starting position and velocity) we can solve for the position at any time step:\n","$$y_1 = y_0 + v_0\\Delta t$$\n","$$y_2 = y_1 + v_1\\Delta t$$\n","$$y_3 = y_2 + v_2\\Delta t$$\n","$$...$$\n","\n","Note that the smaller the time step is the more accurate the solution to the differential equation will be, but this will also increase computational time.

You may assume that air resistance, friction and any other forces besides the spring force can be neglicted.\n","1. Set up an equation that describes the net force acting on the mass.  Using Newton's second law, convert this to an equation for the acceleration of the mass.\n","2. Convert the acceleration equation from above to a Python expression, using indexing on position or velocities as needed (as shown above).\n","3. Set up a function that solves the the motion of the spring using Euler's method. It can take any arguments but must return the position of the spring with respect to time.  Assume that the initial position of the mass is 0.2m and it is released from rest.  Use a t$_{final}$ and $\\Delta$t that seem reasonable for the problem.\n","4. Set up a function that solves the the motion of the spring using the Euler-Cromer method. It can take any arguments but must return the position of the spring with respect to time. Assume that the initial position of the mass is 0.2m and it is released from rest. Use the same t$_{final}$ and $\\Delta$t as part 3.\n","5. Set up a function that solves the the motion of the spring using the Velocity-Verlet method. It can take any arguments but must return the position of the spring with respect to time. Assume that the initial position of the mass is 0.2m and it is released from rest. Use the same t$_{final}$ and $\\Delta$t as part 3.\n","6. Calculate an exact expression for the position of the mass.  For the same time values defined in part 3, calculate the exact solution for the motion of the mass.\n","7. Compare the position of the mass obtined from applying Euler's method, Euler-Cromer method, and the Velocity-Verlet method to the exact position by graphically analyzing the positions and by calculating the appropriate RMSE errors."],"metadata":{"id":"aksCwdHMz1Sg"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"NFw3kXIuz0t5"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"hkP5gn2ezoFB"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
