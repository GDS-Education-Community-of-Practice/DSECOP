    "Model the motion of the Earth strictly under the gravitational force caused by the Sun using Euler's method, the Euler-Cromer method, and the Velocity-Verlet method.  As the final time of the simulation is increased, does the accuracy of each method hold?  Assume that the mass of the sun is 2e30kg, the mass of the Earth is 6e24kg, and the distance between the Sun to the Earth (in a circular orbit) is 152e6km.  Note: Either SI or astronomical units (AU) can be used for this problem, it just depends on the value of the gravitational constant which is chosen.\n",
