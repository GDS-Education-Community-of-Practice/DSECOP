# Introduction to Classification Algorithms
This two-module notebook consists of an introduction to reviewing, analyzing, and classifying physics data. Classification algorithms are critical supervised learning techniques in data science. In a classification problem, we use the information contained in the data to predict the class of the sample. The first notebook in this module will have students analyze a data file containing data for various refractive indexes of optical materials. A suitable classification method could help data scientists determine essential features and boost existing models. This module lets the student observe a natural classification algorithm from a real physics problem. 

## Courses
This module would work well in a physics lab course, with little prior experience with python or
coding. However, understanding basic optics, calculus, and linear algebra should be required.
The level of this module is appropriate for freshman and sophomore-level students. The physics
datasets are drawn from engineering physics, but in-depth physics knowledge is unnecessary.
This module is directed toward lab courses that give students a hands-on understanding of the
data sets from a physical perspective.

## Physics Concepts and Objective
The physics objectives of this module would depend on the course that this module is integrated
with. The focus of this module is to be embedded within lab courses. Since classification
algorithms are versatile in application, they can be applied to other physics curricula besides optics.

## Data Science Objectives
This module intends to introduce students to classification techniques, such as: 

-Make predictions of the speed of light through mediums using logistical regression

-Distinction of classes for refractive index data using Support Vector Machine

-Apply these techniques to classify optical materials by application.

Students will become familiar with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn
to enhance their classification knowledge and data visualization techniques.

## Background Knowledge
The module does not require much experience with python or coding. However, an understanding
of introductory linear algebra and calculus-based physics should be required. Thus, this module
can serve as excellent supplemental material for undergraduate physics courses for students who
are in the process or have already understood the interaction of light with matter.

## Estimated Amount of Time

It is estimated that these notebooks could be completed in a standard 2â€“3-hour lab. If necessary,
the logistical regression module can be broken up into two (1.5 hours) sessions, and the support
vector machine module extended (2 hours).
